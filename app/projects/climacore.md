Life is not all about equations. This is why I took both of the Engineering Entrepreneurship courses offered at Penn. The first class goes through case studies and teaches key business concepts. The second takes students through the process of actually writing a business plan in the most realistic way possible. Presentations are regularly given in class, and the final one is judged by a panel of seasoned venture capitalists. I was voted third best presenter by the panel. 

We envisioned a company named Climacore, which would leverage thermoelectric technology developed at MIT to automatically regulate a person's temperature. Climacore's main line of business would be producing and selling jackets with a coating of this thermoelectric material, allowing them to transfer heat as necessary to keep the user at the desired temperature. We explored the possibilities of this business by conducting market research, devising an operations plan, and calculating the financials. We determined that the best way to enter the market was by selling to winter sport enthusiasts because of the harsh changes in temperature they experience. They would largely profit from the jacket's capabilities and typically have a large disposable income to invest in high-tech gear.
