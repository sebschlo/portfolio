This project consisted of creating a device that would track a spinning IR beacon, and putt a golf ball with a solenoid towards it. Because the beacon was spinning, the values from the phototransistors had to be averaged over a certain amount of loops to prevent false readings. A booster circuit also had to be developed to charge a capacitor with enough voltage to shoot the solenoid. This project had very restricting size constraints as well, which forced me to design a carriage system to place the solenoid over the ball, rather than beside it, and transfer the force with a lever. Finally, measurements were taken at different strenghts so allow for the precise calculation of force depending on the beacon's distance.
