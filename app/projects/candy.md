This project consisted of designing and manufacturing a piece of "desk candy" using SolidCAM and a Haas mini mill. I decided to recreate the helm of the Witchking of Angmar from The Lord of the Rings. Given the part's complicated geometry, I was forced to get creative with my fixturing. I split the face in two to be able to hold each half with 6-32 bolts and then align the two with dowel pins and glue them together. Each half required work from three sides, which meant that the stock had to be prepared with tapped holes in precise locations to ensure they did not interfere with the outer surface of the final part. Furthermore, the chin of the mask would have been left unheld after certain operations, which I compensated for by creating a mount with the chin's contour to hold it in place during the latter machining operations.
