## Solar Powered Autonomous Research Craft

Senior Design is a great opportunity to put everything learned over the years to use. My team is building an autonomous, solar-powered boat capable of venturing into the ocean to collect data and transmit it back to shore. This project can be a useful framework that oceanography, meterology, pollution control, and oil organizations could benefit from. We are interested in pursuing this venture beyond senior design with the hopes of providing affordable access to data about our oceans. 

**This project is also a finalist for the [2014 Intel-Cornell cup](http://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/intel/)! For all sorts of media and updates about the project, check out our [blog](http://blogs.cornell.edu/cornellcup2014sparc/).** 

The boat will have a pontoon structure, with the panel on the top, and a buoy mechanism above that will prevent it from capsizing. Below the panel, a control box will hold the batteries and the brains of the boat. Additionally, a deployable payload will dive deep into the ocean in search of more interesting data. In particular, SPARC will be designed to be able to map the thermocline in a given area, as well as salinity and other insightful metrics. These will come standard with the boat, but the idea is to make is as adaptable as possible so that we can fit the needs of any customer. 

###Early Prototypes

The early prototypes have been crated with 8020 stock aluminum bars, PVC pontoons and Minn Kota trolling motors.

The pontoon clamps were custom made by creating a wooden mold with the desired curvature and using it to press machined aluminum beams into shape.

###Upcoming Tasks

This semester, we will finish the mechanical design of the boat as we conduct our market research. This will allow us to create the design that is most valuable to our potential customers. The control mechanism is also well on its way. As we begin testing in larger bodies of water, such as the Schuylkill River, we will be able to test our code and electronics. The final version of the boat will also feature smoother pontoons for reduced drag, including carbon fiber caps and a special lining, the deployable module, the anti-capsizing mechanism, and of course, a slick appearance!
