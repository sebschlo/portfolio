### On IPD 501

The Integrated CAD and Advanced Manufacturing class at Penn (IPD 501) is definitely one of the most enriching I've taken at Penn. This class builds on the machine shop skills students learn in MEAM 201, where a [Stirling Engine](http://www.sebastianschloesser.com/stirling) is built from scratch. Students learn advanced CAD and surface modeling for CNC machining and other advanced fabrication techniques, such as sheet metals, composites, and injection molding. This semester, I had the opportunity to TA the course, which has not only helped me perfect my own manufacturing and design skills, but has also allowed me to give back to the Penn student community. This class is the only way to gain access to the CNC machines, and  I am glad to be helping other students use the resources offered by Penn to their maximum potential.

### The Tumbler

Last semester, our final project involved building a transformer robot that could operate in two different forms and change between them. This projet was possible because of the cooperation that occurred with the students of the advanced mechatronics class. Each class had 12 students, and we got paired up throughout the semester for several projects. This gave birth to the Tumbler Transformer, both batman's vehicle and his robotic alter ego. In other words, a fully functional car that stands up at the touch of a button into a humanoid robot.

The mechanical design for this project was extremely involved, since many of the parts experienced large loads, yet had to be compact enough to fit together when in car form and light enough for the servos to work. Because of these demanding constraints, we decided to use a mixture of Delrin and aluminum to create the robot's frame. The exterior was then 3D printed to achieve the complicated geometry that we wanted for a batmanesque look. To optimize the available space, the motors for the car are housed within the back wheels and the legs fold into themselves.
