Every year, there is a fight for honor at UPenn; a fight where the disciplines of computer science, mechanical design and electronics are combined, and it is called Robockey. It is a mechatronics tournament where groups of 3 to 4 students create a team of 3 fully autonomous hockey playing robots over the span of 4 weeks and then unleash them against their opponents. I was in charge of writing all the code for my team, which means I had to write a C program capable of running on a microcontroller, that would take inputs from a variety of sensors - from phototransistors to the camera found in a Wii controller - and react intelligently to them in order to score goals. Robots could communicate with each other and strategize as a team, they had finely tuned PID controllers to decipher their location within the rink or swiftly approach the puck, and they could efficiently drive to any point in the rink, smartly overcoming the nonholonomic constraints of a two-wheeled robot. **And the coolest part was that out of about 30 teams of both undergraduate and graduate students, our team got 3rd place!**


All the stats and a recording of the live stream can be found at [the official site](http://www.robockey.com).

This is the face of exhaustion after being awake for about 30 hours. JB (on the left) was in charge of mechanical design, Keelen (in the middle) of electronics, and I was in charge of the code. To the right is our coach, Carlie, who competed the year before. 

###The Robots

Our robots formed the mighty team of **Los Bandidos**. To the left is Discophorus, to the right is Discobolus, and in the back is our goalie, El Tiburon.
