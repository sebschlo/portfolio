This is my greatest Objective-C project. I plan to complete and submit it to the app store before the end of the year. It is essentially a personal data logger and visualizer. The idea is that it can have several modules pertaining to different areas of your life (i.e. time management, sports, sleeping patterns). The UI is key in this project because nobody has the patience to painstakingly track every minute of their day. However, I think most would be interested in looking at beautiful, detailed graphs about this type of metric. Therefore, I came up with a system where the user indicates what percentage of the time since the last log has been dedicated to a specific category. This can be achieved by simply swiping on a pie chart that fills up as the user swipes. This new way of thinking about time not only allows for faster data entry, but is also more relevant, since no one ever does exactly one thing at a time and within a specific interval. The way we use our time is more fluid, and it is more useful to visualize it that way as well. This, however, results in rather awkard chunks of raw data, which means a lot of manipulation and analysis was needed to shape it into something insightful.
