This project entailed creating a synthesizer. In other words, this device produces a perfect sine wave with a microcontroller, op amps and active filters. I used the [M2 Microcontroller](http://medesign.seas.upenn.edu/index.php/Guides/MaEvArM), which was developed at Penn, to produce a PWM signal. This signal was then processed in a handmade circuit to create the necessary wave. The device can also respond to wireless commands and play the indicated frequency for the indicated time. The goal was to have a "director" send notes to many of these devices to play a song!

The design is based on laser-cut MDF boards that come together to make an interesting shape. Half of the circle can be removed and is attached with magnets to allow for easy access to the electronics.
