For this project we built a vertical axis wind turbine. It was an extremely insightful exercise in dimensional analysis because we began by researching shapes and trying them out in the wind tunnel. When we found one that we liked, we had to scale it up significantly and predict the values that we would get. In order to test it, we mounted it on a cart, and attached it to a dc motor to measure the output voltage as we pushed the cart through the hallway.
