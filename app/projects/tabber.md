I have always been frustrated by hunderds of tabs accumulating in Chrome, becoming infinitesimally small and completely unaccessible. I envisioned a tab manager that would allow you to become truly efficient with your browsing, a manager that would allow you to do the following:

1) Look at a screenshot of your all your open tabs (like Mission Control on a Mac) to easily switch to the one you need.

2) Move tabs from one window to another or delete them by dragging them around.

3) Store lists of tabs so you can have different sessions and only look at the tabs you are interested in without closing the rest, but rather storing and hiding them.

4) Snooze tabs for later viewing. 

We decided to implement this tab manager during last fall's PennApps, and this is the demo we submitted.
